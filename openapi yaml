openapi yaml

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
Two features that distinguish YAML from the capabilities of other data-serialization languages are structures[24] and data typing.

YAML structures enable storage of multiple documents within a single file, usage of references for repeated nodes, and usage of arbitrary nodes as keys.

YAML autodetects the datatype of the entity, but sometimes one wants to cast the datatype explicitly.
